#We make an API call and store the response

#We store the response from the API in a variable

#We now process the results 
print( response_dict.keys() )

# A Simple call like this should return a complete set of results, so itâ€™s pretty safe to ignore
# the value associated with 'incomplete_results'. Assuming we were making complex 
# API calls, this program would check this value.
