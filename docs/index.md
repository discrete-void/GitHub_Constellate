### Project Description
_______________________
The script ```python_repos.py```  checks GitHub for 
the most starred python repositories by communicating with
[GitHub's API](https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:python&sort=stars "https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:python&sort=stars")
and renders the result to an [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics "") file using 
[Pygal](https://github.com/Kozea/pygal "Pygal's GitHub Repo").
The SVG file can be visualized in a browser as a Bar-Chart.
